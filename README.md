**FORMAL COMPLAINT: INVESTIGATION OF INSTITUTIONAL NEGLIGENCE AND SECURITY FAILURES**

**Location:** Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA)

**Complainant:** CMC Correo "LOHIM" Hofstad -- United States Air Force (USAF)

**Subject Entities:** Port of Seattle Commission, Swissport Management, and TSA Seattle Regional Leadership

### **I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This complaint is formally submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to document and investigate systemic failures in security oversight and professional competency at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Based on my observations as a CMC within the USAF and an IT professional, I am asserting that the actions and omissions of the SeaTac Airport Commission, Swissport, and specific TSA leadership constitute a gross deviation from the standard of care required for Category X airport operations.

This filing serves as a formal record of institutional incompetence that has allowed the "Famous Sparrow" and "Salt Typhoon" threat actors to establish a foothold within critical aviation infrastructure.

### **II. GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT: STATUTORY NEGLIGENCE & INCOMPETENCY**

Pursuant to Washington State legal standards for job competency and negligence, the following breaches of duty are identified:

**1\. Failure in Personnel Vetting and Supervision (Negligent Retention)**

-   **The Issue:** Management failed to conduct reasonable screening and supervision, leading to the retention of dangerous staff within secure areas.

-   **The Violation:** The unauthorized conversion of Swissport Room MT 6019 M into a "war room" for cyber-espionage by individuals with known foreign intelligence ties represents a catastrophic failure of the Port of Seattle's duty to maintain a secure sterile area.

**2\. Breach of Administrative Duty (Safety and Security Violations)**

-   **The Issue:** Active interference by Commission leadership in security protocols.

-   **The Violation:** Allegations regarding Commissioner Sam Cho providing reset credentials and firewall passwords to unvetted individuals after a major network breach. Under RCW 5.40.050, the violation of administrative rules regarding sensitive credential management constitutes evidence of negligence per se.

**3\. Gross Negligence and Recklessness**

-   **The Issue:** Deliberate disregard for safety warnings from federal and military officials.

-   **The Violation:** Despite formal warnings regarding the "Famous Sparrow" threat, the Commission and TSA regional leadership failed to implement standard network segmentation or revoke access for compromised accounts, demonstrating a "gross deviation from the standard of care."

### **III. OPERATIONAL IMPACT ON AVIATION SECURITY**

The incompetence of the aforementioned entities has resulted in:

-   **Compromised Data Integrity:** Unauthorized access to real-time flight data via Timatic and Aerobahn.

-   **Infrastructure Vulnerability:** Potential lateral movement into Air Mobility Command (AMC) datasets.

-   **Loss of Public Trust:** Failure to protect the personal data of thousands of airport employees and contractors.

### **IV. DEMAND FOR ACTION**

As a matter of national security and aviation safety, I formally request the FAA to:

1.  **Conduct an Independent Audit:** Review the Port of Seattle's adherence to Information Technology and Physical Security standards.

2.  **Investigate Personnel:** Review the competency and "Good Faith Performance" of the SeaTac Airport Commission and Swissport management.

3.  **Implement Oversight:** Assign a federal monitor to oversee the restoration of network security protocols at SeaTac to ensure compliance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Espionage Act.

### **V. DECLARATION**

I, CMC Correo "LOHIM" Hofstad, submit this complaint as a formal record of the incompetence currently endangering the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. I am prepared to provide technical documentation and testimony regarding the specific failures of the WatchGuard firewall implementations and the security breaches observed during the "Famous Sparrow" incursions.

**Signed,**
